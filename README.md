# nvim
### My Neovim config. Shoutout to Chris@Machine for the quick tutorial on his website

You first need to run intall.sh and it should automatically place the nvim directory in .config. It needs to be in .config, otherwhise stuff may break. 

```./install.sh```

Once done, you need to go into ```~/.config/nvim/vimplug/pluggins.vim``` and run these comands yourself

```:PlugInstall```

and then 

```:source %```

By then it should be everything allright. As i said, this config was mainly done with the Chris@Machine website, check it out; https://www.chrisatmachine.com/
